*Last Updated: **August 20, 2025***

> These Terms of Use (the “**Terms**”) govern your use of the Zodico mobile application (the “**App**”), provided by **LBeastwood (SIA RODLEN)** (“**we**”, “**us**”, or the “**Developer**”). If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the App.

---

## 1. Age & Eligibility
- You must be **13+** to use the App. Where local law requires a higher age (e.g., **16+** in parts of the EU), you must meet that higher minimum or obtain verified parental consent.
- You confirm you have not been previously banned from Zodico.

## 2. Relationship to Apple’s Standard EULA
If you downloaded Zodico from the Apple App Store, Apple’s **Standard EULA** also applies: https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/  
If there is a conflict between Apple’s Standard EULA and these Terms, **these Terms control** to the maximum extent permitted by law.

## 3. About Zodico
Zodico is a **moderated social network** for people who enjoy mystical topics (astrology, tarot, dreams). The App offers:
- A **community feed** ("Zodico World") with **user‑generated content (UGC)** and **interactive in‑app attachments** (e.g., a tarot spread you can open and inspect);
- A **safe, empathetic AI companion** for context‑aware conversation **after** a reading is revealed (follow‑ups, clarifier cards);
- **Built‑in translation** of posts and comments so users can read content in their own language;
- **Friends**, **Following**, and **Direct Messages (DMs)**.

**Important**: Zodico provides **reflective guidance** only. It is **not** medical, legal, financial, or psychological advice, and it avoids deterministic claims.

## 4. Accounts & Sign‑In
- You may create an account and an optional profile. You’re responsible for safeguarding credentials and activity under your account.
- **Sign in with Apple**: we use Apple’s Authentication Services. We **do not** require you to provide name/email **immediately after** Sign in with Apple; profile details can be added **later** in Settings.
- You can delete your account at any time in Settings. Deleting the account will schedule removal or anonymization of personal data per our **Privacy Policy**.

## 5. Subscriptions & In‑App Purchases
- **Zodico Premium** is an optional, auto‑renewable subscription. The **title**, **length** (e.g., 1 month / 12 months), and **price** are shown **before purchase** in the App.  
- **Auto‑renewal**: renews automatically unless canceled at least **24 hours** before the current period ends. Manage/cancel in **Settings → Apple ID → Subscriptions**.  
- Any free trial converts to a paid subscription unless canceled before the trial ends.  
- **Restore Purchases**: a dedicated "Restore Purchases" action is provided in the paywall and Settings.  
- Payments are processed by Apple/Google; we do **not** store card numbers.  
- Refunds are handled by Apple/Google according to their policies.

## 6. User‑Generated Content (UGC) & Community Safety (Guideline 1.2)
Zodico enforces a **zero‑tolerance** policy for objectionable content and abusive behavior.

### 6.1 Zero‑Tolerance Policy
You may **not** post, share, solicit, or promote content that includes (without limitation):
- Harassment, bullying, **hate speech**, or discrimination;  
- Sexual content involving minors; non‑consensual or exploitative sexual content;  
- Threats or incitement of **violence** or **self‑harm**;  
- Doxxing, invasion of privacy, or illegal activity;  
- **Spam**, scams, deceptive practices, or malware;  
- Intellectual‑property violations.  
Violations may result in **immediate content removal** and **account ejection**.

### 6.2 Required User Agreement
Before you can post/DM/comment, you must **accept** these Terms and the **Community Guidelines** presented in‑app at first launch (also available in Settings). Acceptance is **enforced server‑side**.

### 6.3 Filtering of Objectionable Content
All posts, comments, **translations**, and DMs are scanned by an automated moderation pipeline (e.g., **OpenAI omni‑moderation**, keyword filters, and rate‑limits). Image attachments may be checked by image‑moderation. High‑severity flags may auto‑hide content pending review.

### 6.4 Reporting & Blocking
- Every post, comment, and DM includes a **Report** option with categories (Harassment, Hate, Sexual, Self‑Harm, Spam, Other).  
- You can **Block** users from their profile or DM; blocking hides their content and prevents new DMs.  
- A confirmation appears after reporting to confirm receipt.

### 6.5 24‑Hour Enforcement Commitment
We review reports and **act within 24 hours** (content removal, account suspension/ejection as appropriate).  
**Contact for escalations**: **moderation@rodlen.com** (also listed in Settings → Community / Moderation).

You agree not to: (a) violate laws; (b) harass, defame, or infringe rights; (c) post obscene/extremely violent content; (d) spam or run unauthorized promotions; (e) reverse engineer or interfere with the App; (f) bypass safety filters.

## 9. Intellectual Property
The App, including trademarks, UI, code, and assets, is owned by us or our licensors. You may not copy, modify, or create derivative works except as permitted by law or by written permission.

## 10. Disclaimers & Limitation of Liability
ZODICO IS PROVIDED **“AS IS”** WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we are **not liable** for indirect, incidental, or consequential damages. Our aggregate liability is limited to the amount you paid in the **preceding 6 months** (or **$0** if none).

## 11. Termination
You may terminate your account in Settings. We may suspend or terminate access for violations, abuse, or operational reasons. Termination does not entitle you to refunds.

## 12. Translations & Accuracy Notice
UGC and AI outputs may be **translated** automatically; translations can be imperfect or context‑dependent. Use your own judgment and report inaccuracies or abuse.

## 13. Governing Law & Disputes
These Terms are governed by the laws of **Latvia (EU)**. Courts of **Latvia** have exclusive jurisdiction, subject to mandatory consumer protections.
